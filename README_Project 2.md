# Multiple Year Stock Data Analysis

This code is a VBA macro in excel for analysing stock market data on multiple worksheets. The code is a For Loop through all data in the workbook. The greatest increase, greatest decrease, and greatest total volume are made outside the loop and show only in 2018 ws.

# Note 1

At the moment of submission of this project, the code is not performing properly. Still some errors in calculating "greatest increase", "greatest decrease" and "greatest total volume"

# Note 2

Please note that some class mates and I collaborated on this project and I have incorporated some of the ideas/structures of class mates into my code.
